## 2.1.0 (February 5, 2019)

ARCHITECTURAL:

* Project switched to using Go modules. It is worth having a
look at [README.md](README.md) to understand how Go modules impact build and development.

FEATURES:

* New insert and eject media functions 

IMPROVEMENTS:

* vApp vapp.PowerOn() implicitly waits for vApp to exit "UNRESOLVED" state which occurs shortly after creation and causes vapp.PowerOn() failure.
* VM has new functions which allows to configure cores for CPU. VM.ChangeCPUCountWithCore()

BREAKING CHANGES:

* Deprecate vApp.ChangeCPUCountWithCore() and vApp.ChangeCPUCount()
